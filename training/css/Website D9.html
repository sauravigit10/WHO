        The idea that happier farm animals produce higher quality food is not new, and it seems to be catching on. Several small scale egg farmers have transitioned to a “pastured” system, allowing their chickens to roam freely to eat grass and bugs the way nature intended. These chickens are not simply “free range” or “cage free,” which are terms that unfortunately don’t have much meaning in today’s food market
